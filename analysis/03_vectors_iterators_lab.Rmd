# Learning Objectives

- Practice manipulating vectors.
- Practice for loops.
- Practice `purrr`.

# Exercise 1: Simulations

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

1. Write a function that uses a for loop that, for each iteration, randomly 
   draws 5 observations from an exponential distribution with rate parameter 1
   (use `rexp()`) and calculates its mean. It should do this 10,000 times. Choose
   an appropriate plot to plot the distribution of means.
    
2. Repeat part 1 by using a `map_*()` function.

3. Repeat part 1 by using the `replicate()` function.

4. Use a another for loop that will print out plots for sample sizes of 5, 10,
   and 20 observations (instead of just 5).
   

# Exercise 2: Star Trek

For this exercise, load in the following dataset.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
st <- list(
  franchise = "Star Trek",
  series = c("TOS", "TNG", "DS9", "VOY", "ENT"),
  starship = tribble(~ID,         ~class,         ~name,       ~length,  ~launched,
                     ##----------/---------------/------------/---------/----------
                     "NCC-1701",  "constitution", "Enterprise", 288.646, 2245,
                     "NCC-1701D", "galaxy",       "Enterprise", 642.5,   2361,
                     "NX-74205",  "defiant",      "Defiant",    170,     2370,
                     "NCC-74656", "intrepid",     "Voyager",    343,     2371),
  captain = tribble(~firstname,  ~lastname, ~ship,       ~drink,
                    ##----------/----------/------------/----------
                    "James",     "Kirk",    "NCC-1701",  "brandy",
                    "Jean-luc",  "Picard",  "NCC-1701D", "tea",
                    "Benjamin",  "Sisko",   "NX-74205",  "coffee",
                    "Katherine", "Janeway", "NCC-74656", "coffee"),
  age = as.duration(today() - ymd(19660908))
)
```

1. Use an appropriate function to see the components of `st` in a concise way.

2. Use R code to determine the class of each element of `st`.
    
3. It seems that `starship` and `captain` can be merged into one data frame.
   Do this now.
   
    Your `st` list should now look like this:
   
# Exercise 3: Diamonds

1. Load in the `diamonds` data frame from the ggplot2 package.

2. Calculate summary statistics (using `summary()`) for all quantitative
   variables.
    
3. To fit a linear model of `price` on `depth` and extract the $p$-value for 
   the regression coefficient of `depth`, you would use the following R code:
    
    Fit a separate linear model for `price` on `depth` for each level of 
    `color`. Extract the $p$-values for the regression coefficients.

4. Plot `depth` vs `price`, faceting by `color`, including an OLS line. Do the
   $p$-values in the previous question roughly match what you would expect based
   on the plots?
